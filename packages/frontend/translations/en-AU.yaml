    whatIsQ: What is emberclear
    whatIsA: >
      emberclear is the open source p2p encrypted chat client that operates over open source mesh nodes on free-tier cloud services.
    howDoesWorkQ: How does it work?
    howDoesWorkA: >
      All the encryption is done in the browser -- at no time do private keys leave your computer. Emberclear uses libsodium's public key-cryptography to ensure cryptographically safe messaging across the internet, on any network -- even if the network is compromised.
    whyQ: Why?
    whyA: >
      Partially for fun and learning -- wanting to provide a framework for people wanting to get in to web applications so that they pre-existing tools that can interface with their creations. This project is also inspired by a lack of trust in existing chat apps and their infrastructure. Ultimately, this project, by functionality, will be a clone of whatever is popular - with the one key difference that nothing is ever tracked by the relays / federated nodes.
    notOnlineQ: What happens when I send a message and the recipient is no longer online.
    notOnlineA: >
      The server does not store any messages, and does not keep a queue of undelivered messages. If a recipient is not online, the message will manually need to be resent.
    serverStorageQ: Does the server / relay store any of my messages ever?
    serverStorageA: "No."

    overwriteTitle: Are you sure you want to create a new identity?
    overwriteQuestion: >
      This is a destructive action, that will cause the currently configured identity to be forgotten and replaced. There is no way to recover, and without having the mnemonic saved somewhere, you will be unable to connect with any of the previously configured chats as no one will know who you are. <br> <br> Are you sure you want to do this?
    overwriteAbort: No, take me back to safety
    overwriteConfirm: Yes, I understand the risks

    mnemonicPrompt: >
      If you would like to use this account on other computers, please store this mnemonic in a secure place. It will be used to login.
    note: >
      You may download your settings at any time so that you can upload them to another computer. The settings will include more than just your identity.
