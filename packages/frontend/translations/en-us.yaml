    title: F.A.Q
    whatIsQ: What is emberclear
    whatIsA: >
      emberclear is the open source p2p encrypted chat
      client that operates over open source
      mesh nodes on free-tier cloud services.
    howDoesWorkQ: How does it work?
    howDoesWorkA: >
      All the encryption is done in the browser -- at no time do private keys leave your computer.
      Emberclear uses libsodium's public key-cryptography to ensure cryptographically safe messaging
      across the internet, on any network -- even if the network is compromised.
    whyQ: Why?
    whyA: >
      Partially for fun and learning -- wanting to provide a framework
      for people wanting to get in to web applications so that they pre-existing
      tools that can interface with their creations.

      This project is also inspired by a lack of trust in existing chat apps and their infrastructure.

      Ultimately, this project, by functionality, will be a clone of whatever
      is popular - with the one key difference that nothing is ever tracked
      by the relays / federated nodes.

    overwriteTitle: Are you sure you want to create a new identity?
    overwriteQuestion: >
      This is a destructive action, that will
      cause the currently configured identity to be forgotten and
      replaced. There is no way to recover, and without having the
      mnemonic saved somewhere, you will be unable to connect with any
      of the previously configured chats as no one will know who you are.
