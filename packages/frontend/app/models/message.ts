 *
 * WHISPER:    same as chat, but explictly only intended for a single person
 *
 * PING:       a system message used to determine who is online upon app-boot
 *
 * DELIVERY_CONFIRMATION: a system message automatically sent back to someone
 *                        who sent you a message so that they know you received it
 *
 * DISCONNECT: a courtesy message to notify your contacts that you
 *             are about to go offline.
 *
 * Properties of:
 *   Chat, Emote
 *   - channel: the id of the channel this message is intended for
 *              NOTE: additional channel properties (such as encryption, members, etc)
 *                    will ultimately be stored on the channel.
 *                    However, in order to make sure everyone's member list is up to date,
 *                    the member list will be sent along wich each message
 *              TODO: decide whether these extra properties live in the body json
 *              TODO: do we want structureless data in the body?
 *
 *   Whisper, Ping, Disconnect
 *   - no properties that alter behavior / message routing
 *
 * Currently Unused Properties:
 *  - contentType, thread
