# Gitlab's pipelines have about 3.5 minutes of overhead per stage
# see previous run: https://gitlab.com/NullVoxPopuli/emberclear/pipelines/24394951/builds
# where all the pipeline steps are split out
#
# This one stage takes on average: 6-8 minutes
# All the stages take on average: 20-25 minutes
#
# This likely due to the (un)zipping of cache
# and network transfer between gitlab and wherever cache is stored.
#
# Using a self-hosted gitlab-runner with local-to-the-runner-cache
# would be a huge win.
