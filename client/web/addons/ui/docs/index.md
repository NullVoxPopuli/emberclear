Welcome to Field Guide ðŸŽ‰

You have now successfully setup your own Field Guide, if things are looking a bit bare bones right now that's because Field Guide is designed to provide as few styles as possible so it doesn't interfere with your own styleguide or design system.

If you want to see an example of a full Field Guide in the wild you can [check out the Ember Styleguide](https://ember-styleguide.netlify.com/).
